      "1": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs."

      "2": "The self-attention mechanism allows each position in the encoder (or decoder) to attend over all positions in the previous layer of the encoder (or decoder). Specifically, for a set of queries Q, keys K, and values V, the attention is computed as Attention(Q,K,V)=softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V, where d_k is the dimension of the key vectors. In practice, we compute multi-head attention: MultiHead(Q,K,V)=Concat(head_1,...,head_h)W^O, where head_i=Attention(QW_i^Q,KW_i^K,VW_i^V). This allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, capturing richer relationships and improving contextual understanding of sequences."
